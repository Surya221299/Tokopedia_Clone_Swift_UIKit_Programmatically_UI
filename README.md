iOS Tokopedia Clone Build using Swift and Programmatic UI

Tokopedia Clone is portfolio app i build to learn and practice the Swift programming language, and the UIKit framework Programmatically, because I realize that to work as an iOS Developer, SwiftUI skills alone are not enough, that's why I studied the UIKit framework by making this application.
